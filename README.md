# ResumeTailor

> Resume Tailor AI

Resume Tailor AI is a web application that helps job seekers tailor their resumes to specific job descriptions using AI.

A clear analysis of what’s missing or misaligned

Actionable suggestions to improve their resume

A newly generated, tailored version of the resume

An editable resume experience with export options

The goal is to save time, improve resume relevance, and help candidates apply with more confidence.
